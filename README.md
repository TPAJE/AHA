# ALOHA - An AI-guided tool for the automatic assessment of venom-induced haemorrhage in mice

For an analysis and experimental code for this tool see the associated GitHub repository: [ALOHA-Experiments](https://github.com/laprade117/ALOHA-Experiments)

We will hopefully have a more permanent link to the tool in the near future. Currently, you can access and use the tool via Google Colabs (requires Google Account) here: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/laprade117/ALOHA/blob/main/ALOHA.ipynb)
